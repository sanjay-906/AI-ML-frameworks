    "*   [Sample Factory](https://www.samplefactory.dev/) is an advanced RL framework and **only functions on Linux and Mac** (not Windows).\n",
    "\n",
    "*  The framework performs best on a **GPU machine with many CPU cores**, where it can achieve speeds of 100k interactions per second. The resources available on a standard Colab notebook **limit the performance of this library**. So the speed in this setting **does not reflect the real-world performance**.\n",

    "The *inferences workers* query a fixed version of the policy and **send actions back to the rollout worker**.\n",

    "- **Encoder** - Process input observations (images, vectors) and map them to a vector. This is the part of the model you will most likely want to customize.\n",
    "- **Core** - Intergrate vectors from one or more encoders, can optionally include a single- or multi-layer LSTM/GRU in a memory-based agent.\n",
